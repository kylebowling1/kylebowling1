Hi, I'm @kylebowling1 and I'm interested in VBA, Python, C#, and RPA. My passion for programming started by discovering VBA at my first finance job out of college
and diving head first into a dictionary of every function & keyword of the language. From their I've grown and learned python, SQL, and RPA (Blue Prism & Automation Anywhere).
I'm interested in improving my SQL skills and learning C# in order to effectively manage data and develop C# DLLs that can be used in combination with RPA to automate
manual process. You can contact me at kyle93oak@hotmail.com or on <strong>LinkedIn</strong> at
